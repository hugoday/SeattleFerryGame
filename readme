Ferry start port selection
Select ferry from port
Cargo in port graphic
Distance calculation and time of travel
Ferry follows route
Updgradable docks
Create map
Window size adjust
Create sprites

Long term ideas:
Islands:
  Move back clouds to reveal
  Have bad dock by default, needs fixing
  Repairs pay small profit for materials
  Large reward for full repair
  Will have jobs and deliveries when fixed

Ports
  Can be upgraded for more jobs, docks
  Each dock can have a ferry
  Upgrade with wood and money
  Maybe profit from bringing wood

Shipyard:
  Buy/build new ships
  Upgrade speed, efficiency, limited size upgrade

Have an RPG element to exploration. Can come across story parts
Floating containers?
  Get maps, special upgrade items

Boat has maintinence and fuel costs
