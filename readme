TODO:
Create map
Ferry start port selection
Create sprites

Long term ideas:
Islands:
    Move back clouds to reveal
    Have bad dock by default, needs fixing
    Repairs pay small profit for materials
    Large reward for full repair
    Will have jobs and deliveries when fixed

Docks
    Can be upgraded for more jobs, boats
    Upgrade with wood and money
    Maybe profit from bringing wood

Shipyard:
    Buy/build new ships
    Upgrade speed, efficiency, limited size upgrade

Have an RPG element to exploration. Can come across story parts
Floating containers?
    Get maps, special upgrade items

Boat has maintinence and fuel costs

Dock
  is
    StaticElement
  has
    ferry[]
    cargo[]

DockMenu

  acts on
    dock
    ferry
