Long term ideas:
Islands:
  Move back clouds to reveal
  Have bad dock by default, needs fixing
  Repairs pay small profit for materials
  Large reward for full repair
  Will have jobs and deliveries when fixed

Ports
  Can be upgraded for more jobs, docks, larger staging area
  Each dock can have a ferry
  Upgrade with wood and money
  Maybe profit from bringing wood

  Jobs
    Will fill to max job capacity then start replacing randomly

  Staging area
    Used for layovers or saving jobs for later
    Can stage or load cargo from port
      Stage items without a ship to not discard on random refresh
    Can move ferry items to/from stage 
    Can unstage staged items
      Moved to jobs if space
      Discarded if no space

  Stage from dock menu or cargo menu?
    Cargo menu
  Stage to specific dock or in general?
    General staging, maybe change with upgraded individual docks
  Different size docks for larger boats???
    Maybe, save for later

Shipyard:
  Buy/build new ships
  Upgrade speed, efficiency, limited size upgrade

Have an RPG element to exploration. Can come across story parts
Floating containers?
  Get maps, special upgrade items

Boat has maintinence and fuel costs
  Components - issue if damaged
    Engine - very slow
    Hull - less storage
    Navigation - increased fuel cost
